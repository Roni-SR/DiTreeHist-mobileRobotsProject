# DiTreeHist-mobileRobotsProject
This project explores a hybrid motion planning framework that combines diffusion-based generative models with tree-expansion algorithms, extending the recently proposed DiTree.  Inspired by MAMBA, this method leverages past interactions for informed decision-making by using a GRU-based Action History Encoder.
